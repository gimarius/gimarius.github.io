                </header>
                <p>I am really into skiing and this season 2022/23 snowfall was very rare. Most of the time the
                    skiresorts
                    looked like the picture below. It was miserable. I planned to go skiing over the Christmas break,
                    however,
                    it turned out that there was too little snow. There was no snow and I had a lot of free time, so I
                    looked
                    into the data of our ski resorts in Switzerland. I had no specific goal in mind. I started gathering
                    data
                    with Python scrapers, transformed the data and displayed the data with different tools such as Power
                    BI
                    from Microsoft, Pandas as a Python library and Plotly as another Python library. The goal in the end
                    turned
                    out to have fun in working with interesting data and applying techniques to the data.</p>

                    <h2>Data Colletion</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I found three webpages with interesting data and started to collect the data.</p>

                <h3>Skiresort.ch</h3>
                <p>The webpage displays 356 ski resorts in Switzerland. It shows a ranking, the lowest altitude, the
                    highest
                    altitude, the total length of the slopes (divided in black, red, blue), the number of ski lifts and
                    the
                    price of a ski pass in Swiss Francs and Euro. I crawled the data with this <a href="https://github.com/gimarius/
                Swiss-Ski-Resorts/blob/main/Data_Collection/Crawler_Skiresort_ch.py">crawler on Github</a>. The crawler
                    is
                    build with selenium and the data manipulation is done with pandas. The output of the crawler is then
                    stored the folder Data.

                </p>

                <h3>MySwitzerland.ch</h3>

                <p>MySwitzerland also provides information about Swiss ski resorts, however, the number of the resorts
                    is
                    smaller. I crawled the data from MySwitzerland too and used the same tools. The code can be found <a
                            href="https://github.com/gimarius/Swiss-Ski-Resorts/blob/main/Data_Collection/Crawler_MySwitzerland.py">here
                        on Github</a>


                <h3>Bergfex.ch</h3>

                <p>Since I was not very happy with the result from Skiresorts.ch and MySwitzerland, especially in terms
                    of displaying the current conditions, for example snowfall overnight. I crawled a page from <a
                            href="https://www.bergfex.ch/schweiz/schneewerte/">Bergfex.ch</a>
                    too. The code can be found <a

                        <p>After a few manual changes in the excel-file, I had an overview of the 356 ski resorts from
                            the skiresort.ch website. I immediately put the data into a Power Bi report, however, when I
                            tried to map the data with Power BI and Power Bi displayed dots from all over the world. So
                            I knew, I had to enrich the data, to get unique values for the
                            location. To get a map of the datapoint without the exact location I used the cantons as a
                            geolocation and
                            created a first draft in PowerBI. </p>

            <p>I enriched the data with Post Codes from a dataset from the Swiss Post, mapped the data again
                and I had still wrong datapoints on the map. So I looked for geodata: Altitude and longitude. Again
                I found a dataset from the <a href="https://swisspost.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/plz_verzeichnis_v2/

            </header>
            <p>With the enriched Data I could create a more detailed Power BI Report. The report shows the altitude
                of the 355 skiresorts I have crawled.My take-away from the creation of the map in Power BI is that
                it is very easy to create a map, however,
                the customization possibilities are limited.</p>

            <p>As a next step, I will continue with the data visualisation in Python and its libraries. </p>

                <h2>Data Analysis in Python</h2>
            </header>

            <p>As I love working with Python and its handy and effective functions, I visualised the data with it.
                The code can be found <a
                        href="https://github.com/gimarius/Swiss-Ski-Resorts/blob/main/Data_Visualisation/Plotly_Analysis.ipynb">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Bar Chart with Plotly Express - Bar</h3>
            <p>First I created a new dataframe, by grouping the data with pandas groupby-function. Then I plotted
                the data to create a grouped bar chart. Most of the ski resorts are located in the canton of Bern,
                however, most ski resorts in the canton, have their highest point below 2000 meters. The most
                ski resorts above 2000 meters are located in the canton of Wallis and Graubünden. In 13 of 24
                cantons,
                ski resorts are located below 2000 meters.</p>

                    <h3>Bar Chart with Plotly Express - Pie</h3>
                    <p>After the creation of the bar chart I plotted this pie chart. The pie chart that nearly three
                        quarters of all Swiss ski resorts have their highest point below 2000 meters.</p>

                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
                    <p>Firstly, I created a map with the px.scatter_geo function. This is a function for a Geo Maps,
                        which is used to create
                        outline-based maps. I used the latitude and the longitude as I did it with the second
                        PowerBI Map. I set the geo_scope to "Europe" and let the
                        map focus on the point on the map. However, I was not satisfied with the result, since the
                        map provides too little details.</p>
                    <p>Click on the map legend to adjust the data points. Hovering over the datapoints the
                        corresponding ski resort is displayed.</p>

                <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

                    <p>Secondly, I created a map with the px.scatter_mapbox function. The Mapbox maps are tile-based
                        maps.
                        I used the same approach with the longitude and latitude as the locations on the map. The
                        mapbox_style is set to"Carto-positron".
                        I used the style since it fitted the most and I did not have to get a Mapbox Access
                        token.</p>
                    <p>Click on the map legend to adjust the data points. Hovering over the datapoints the
